CPP-Modules are C++ projects with the main goal of OOP where we will learn about Namespaces, classes, stdio streams, errors handling in C++, STL.  
CPP00 Exercises:  
EX00 (Megaphone):  
Create a program which take command line arguments then capitalize each alphapatical character in the arguments then output them to the standard output in C++ manner.  
EX01 (My Awesome PhoneBook):  
Create a program which is similar to an old contacts software that can only store 8 temporary contacts, the program accepts 3 commands: ADD, SEARCH, EXIT where ADD will add a contact and SEARCH will search for a contact with specific index and EXIT is self explanatory.  
EX02 (The Job Of Your Dreams):  
This exersice will simulate a problem about a lost source file where you only have the header file for the Account class declerations with tests.cpp source file which will test the Account class methods with an old log file of the expected result you should recreate the lost source file using the info provided.
