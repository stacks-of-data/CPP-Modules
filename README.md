# CPP-Modules
CPP-Modules are C++ projects with the main goal of OOP where we will learn about Namespaces, classes, stdio streams, errors handling in C++, STL, Memory Allocation, References, Pointers to member functions.  
## CPP00  
In this module we learned how to create a class and use it and how to use namespaces correctly, and the usage of streams and correctly error handling in C++.  
EX00 (Megaphone):  
Create a program which take command line arguments then capitalize each alphapatical character in the arguments then output them to the standard output in C++ manner.  
EX01 (My Awesome PhoneBook):  
Create a program which is similar to an old contacts software that can only store 8 temporary contacts, the program accepts 3 commands: ADD, SEARCH, EXIT where ADD will add a contact and SEARCH will search for a contact with specific index and EXIT is self explanatory.  
EX02 (The Job Of Your Dreams):  
This exersice will simulate a problem about a lost source file where you only have the header file for the Account class declerations with tests.cpp source file which will test the Account class methods with an old log file of the expected result you should recreate the lost source file using the info provided.  
## CPP01
In this module we learned how to do memory allocation in C++ using new and delete, and we learned about the difference between pointers and references and how to create pointers to members functions.  
EX00 (BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ):  
Create a class called zombie which has an attribute name and announce method which will print zombie name with Brainzzzzzz, then create 2 functions one newZombie which allocate zombie object then returns a pointer to it and the other is randomChump which will create a zombie then announce it and destroy it.  
EX01 (Moar brainz!):  
Create a function called zombieHorde which takes 2 arguments N and name, it will create an array of zombies with singl allocation then it will set each zombie name in the array then return the pointer to the first element in the array.   
EX02 (HI THIS IS BRAIN):  
Create a str variable which holds the value "HI THIS IS BRAIN", then create 2 variables first a pointer to str second a reference to str then print the address of the variables  
EX03 (Unnecessary violence):  
Create 3 classes Weapon which holds string attribute and getType, setType methods, HumanA with a constructor which always takes a name with a weapon, HumanB which is the same as HumanA but doesn't always have a weapon.  
EX04 (Sed is for losers):  
Create a program in C++ which takes 3 arguments: filename, s1, s2 it will create a new file with the same filename with .replace appended to it that has all matches of s1 replaced with s2.  
EX05 (Harl 2.0):
Create a class called Harl which has 5 methods debug, info, warning, error, complain which takes a string, the goal is to execute the correct method based on the level provided without a forest of if conditions using pointers to members functions.  
EX06 (Harl filter):  
The same as ex05 but it should print all the levels above the level provided as an argument with switch statment.
