# CPP-Modules
CPP-Modules are C++ projects with the main goal of OOP where we will learn about Namespaces, classes, stdio streams, errors handling in C++, STL, Memory Allocation, References, Pointers to member functions.  
## CPP00  
In this module we learned how to create a class and use it and how to use namespaces correctly, and the usage of streams and correctly error handling in C++.   
## CPP01
In this module we learned how to do memory allocation in C++ using new and delete, and we learned about the difference between pointers and references and how to create pointers to members functions.   
## CPP02
In this module we learned about creating classes in orthodox canonical class and the fixed datatype which was used on older computers for memory optimization, Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads.  
## CPP03
In this module we learned about inheritance by creating a derived classes that inherits members of a base class.  
## CPP04
In this module we learned about Subtype polymorphism, Abstract classes, Interfaces (Pure abstract classes).  
## CPP05
In this module we have learned clean error handling with try-catch blocks.  
## CPP06
In this module we learned different types of casting to cast datatypes safely.  
## CPP07
In this module we learned templates functions/classes to create generalized functions/classes that can accept more than one datatype.  
## CPP08
In this module we learned about STL containers to store data in different ways based on the task, and the use of iterators to iterate a container, and the usage of algorithms library.  
## CPP09
In this module we put all what we have learned from previous modules into practice, the challenge is to solve each exercise with at least one STL container except the last exercise which requires 2 with the condition of not being able to reuse the used container in next exercises.
